# NWB Showcase

OSB Showcase project containing examples of [Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)](https://www.nwb.org/) data.

OSB is developing the infrastructure to visualise and analyse experimental data which has been shared publicly in NWB format.

This repository will contain **some example datasets** which we will convert to NWB to test this functionality. 

The target format will be NWB v2.0 and we intend to make use of [PyNWB](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb) for reading/writing the NWB files.
